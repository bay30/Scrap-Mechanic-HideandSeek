###### Gamemode designed to be played with friends

Hide and seek with automatic tagging on melee or projectile
with distance written into nametags and super customize maps with tiles and worlds (if you do some modding to write tiles & worlds)

## How do i play?
Lanuch the gamemode and load in a creation, if the creation is made for the gamemode a menu will popup, otherwise go into mod parts and place a publishblock,
save first then interact with the publish block and set your settings and play!

You need seeker & hider spawn points and once your finished and ready to upload place a publish block set the settings if you wish and save.
Hiders spawn on `Hider Spawnpoint`
